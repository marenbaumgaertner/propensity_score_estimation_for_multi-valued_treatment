# Propensity Score Estimation for multi-valued Treatment Evaluation using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation related to my master's thesis titled "Propensity Score Estimation for multi-valued Treatment Evaluation using Machine Learning".

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for the implementation, experimentation, and analysis conducted as part of my master's thesis project. The thesis compares the copetitive performance of several probabilistic classifiers for multi-class problems including state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
Besides the inherently multi-class model, I study the two strategies which binarise the multi-valued treatment problem.
